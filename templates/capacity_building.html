on climate action calls for global outcomes.
However, most implementation will be local. And experiences of climate change impacts are place specific.
A ‘local lens’ focusing on indicators for local action and adaptation is therefore crucial for informing global approaches to addressing climate change.

<p>
The research programme Pastoralist Climate Change Resilience in Somaliland (PACCS) (2022-2027) will generate cutting-edge theoretical and policy knowledge on local climate change resilience in Somaliland, focusing on the critical but overlooked livelihood system of pastoralism. It takes a cross-sectoral approach, and accounts for pastoralist climate resilience strategies across the domains of markets, land management and governance.

    <h2>In addressing this gap, PACCS will:</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>GIS:</b> We triangulate qualitative methods (fieldwork, qualitative interviews, focus groups) with quantitative surveys and the use of Participatory Geographic Information Systems.</li>
<li><b>CAPACITY BUILDING:</b> Strengthen research capacities, institutional collaboration and South-South as well as North-South collaboration in the field of pastoralist climate resilience research.</li>
<li><b>PUBLICATIONS:</b> Provide innovative research-based knowledge on pastoralist climate resilience, and contribute to an empirically-driven (re)theorization and disaggregation of the resilience concept into finer-tuned categories, thereby enhancing its conceptual use for applied climate change research. </li>
<li><b>EVENTS:</b> Translate insights on pastoralist climate resilience in Somaliland into policy recommendations to inform grounded, inclusive and integrated approaches to address climate change.</li>
</ol>
