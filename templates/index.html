    <h3 class="display-5">PACCS: Pastoralist Climate Change Resilience in Somaliland</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Pastoralism is the dominant livelihood for millions of East Africans, severely affected by climate change (drought, flash floods, weather variability).
        It is also a crucial locus of climate resilience, as pastoral systems have always adapted to challenging environmental conditions.
        However, pastoralismâ€™s inherent resilience potentials have received limited academic attention and policy engagement.

    <h2>In addressing this gap, PACCS will:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><b>GIS:</b> We triangulate qualitative methods (fieldwork, qualitative interviews, focus groups) with quantitative surveys and the use of Participatory Geographic Information Systems.</li>
        <li><b>CAPACITY BUILDING:</b> Strengthen research capacities, institutional collaboration and South-South as well as North-South collaboration in the field of pastoralist climate resilience research.</li>
        <li><b>PUBLICATIONS:</b> Provide innovative research-based knowledge on pastoralist climate resilience and contribute to an empirically-driven (re)theorization and disaggregation of the resilience concept into finer-tuned categories, thereby enhancing its conceptual use for applied climate change research.</li>
        <li><b>EVENTS:</b> Translate insights on pastoralist climate resilience in Somaliland into policy recommendations to inform grounded, inclusive and integrated approaches to address climate change.</li>
    </ol>
